The worst quote pack in UNIX history, ever.

This is for the fortune program that adds various quotes that I find funny. What it basically means is that it contains some of the stupidest craps possible. Only install this if you think it is funny (it is not).

## Features
- Stupid Memes
- Terrible Jokes
- Dumb references
- and so much more (and worse)

## Here's how you install it
You need to have `fortune` installed.

Simply copy both `jkrandosilly` and `jkrandosilly.dat` into `/usr/share/fortune` and you're done!

Enjoy. I hope.
