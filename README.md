The worst quote packs in UNIX history.

Qoutes for the fortune program that adds various quotes that I found funny.

## Features
- Stupid Memes
- Terrible Jokes
- Dumb references
- and so much more (and worse)

Only install this if you can handle all of these.

## Here's how you install it anyway
Copy both `jkrandosilly` and `jkrandosilly.dat` into `/usr/share/fortune` and you're done! Enjoy. I hope
